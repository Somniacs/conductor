# Changelog

All notable changes to Conductor are documented here.

## v0.3.7

### Git worktree isolation

- **Worktree sessions** — run any agent (Claude Code, Aider, Codex, Goose, Copilot, etc.) in an isolated git worktree so each session gets its own branch and working copy — no conflicts between parallel agents or your own work. Auto-commits on exit, merge back with squash/merge/rebase strategies
- **Worktree CLI** — `conductor run -w` to start a worktree session; `conductor worktree list|merge|discard|gc` to manage them
- **Worktree dashboard** — worktree toggle in new-session dialog, color-coded badge pill (green = active, blue = finalized, red = orphaned, orange = stale) with branch name and commit count. Finalized sessions persist in the sidebar until merged or discarded
- **Worktree diff view** — "diff" button on active and finalized worktrees opens a syntax-highlighted unified diff dialog (additions in green, deletions in red, file headers in amber, hunks in blue)
- **Worktree finalize button** — "finalize" button on active worktree sessions gracefully stops the agent, auto-commits changes, and keeps the session in the sidebar for merge/discard

### File uploads

- **Upload progress bar** — file uploads now show a real-time progress bar with loaded/total MB and percentage
- **Desktop drag-and-drop upload** — drag files directly onto a terminal panel to upload; also supports clipboard paste (Ctrl+V) and the panel header attachment button
- **Desktop upload button** — paperclip icon in the panel header for file uploads on desktop (touch devices use the existing extra-keys button)
- **Configurable upload warning** — no hard upload size limit; files over the configured threshold (default 20 MB) prompt for confirmation. Threshold is adjustable in Settings ("Upload warning")

### Dashboard UI

- **Machine icons** — sidebar server group headers now show a monitor icon for clearer visual distinction from session items
- **Empty state action** — the "Select a session or create a new one" screen now includes a "+ New Session" button to create a session directly
- **Panel overflow menu** — header actions (theme, upload, font size, maximize) collapsed into a "⋯" menu; only the close button remains in the header bar
- **Move panel** — rearrange panels in the layout via directional arrows (← → ↑ ↓) in the overflow menu
- **Cleaner resumable sessions** — removed redundant red "resumable" badge from sidebar; the green play button is sufficient

### CLI

- **CLI resume** — `conductor resume <name>` resumes an exited session from the terminal, attaching automatically (use `-d` to resume in background)
- **Restart/shutdown safety** — `conductor restart` and `conductor shutdown` now warn about active sessions before killing them; pass `-f` to skip

### Fixes

- Fixed browser-created sessions ("+New" in UI) showing the cursor ~2 lines below its actual position — replaced `fitAddon.fit()` with unified manual cell measurement matching the working CLI code path; also affected desktop when resizing the sidebar
- Fixed extra-keys bar staying visible after cancelling the file picker on mobile/tablet
- Fixed upload dialog overflowing on small phone screens
- Queue overflow in subscriber broadcast now logs a warning instead of silently dropping output

## v0.3.6

### Fixes

- Fixed cursor appearing one line too low on mobile — uses actual rendered cell height to prevent sub-pixel rounding from allocating an extra row

## v0.3.5

### New features

- **Tablet support** — touch scrolling, extra-keys bar, and custom scrollbars now work on tablets (previously only activated below 700px width); uses `pointer: coarse` media query to detect touch devices without affecting touchscreen laptops
- **Keyboard-aware extra keys** — extra-keys bar appears when the virtual keyboard opens and positions itself above it, including on tablets in desktop browser mode (uses the Visual Viewport API with focusin fallback)
- **Maximize panel** — double-click a session title bar to maximize that panel; double-click again or click any session in the sidebar to restore the split layout
- **Open panel indicators** — sessions placed in the view show a highlighted left border in the sidebar, so you can tell which sessions are open vs unplaced

### Fixes

- Extra-keys drawer expand/collapse now correctly resizes the terminal in all modes
- Body height properly accounts for extra-keys bar when the keyboard is open in desktop browser mode

## v0.3.4

### New features

- **Smooth native scrolling** — one-finger scrolling on mobile is now hardware-accelerated with native momentum, replacing the custom JavaScript scroll handler for dramatically lower latency
- **Focused panel on mobile** — when the keyboard opens with multiple panels, only the active panel is shown at full size; the split layout restores when the keyboard closes
- **Compact extra keys** — reduced vertical size of the mobile extra-keys bar so more terminal content is visible

### Fixes

- Mobile terminal no longer shifts upward after scrolling
- Faster reconnection on mobile (reduced from 2s to 500ms)

## v0.3.3

### New features

- **Combined touch scroll** — vertical and horizontal scrolling work simultaneously on mobile with momentum on both axes; no direction locking
- **Horizontal scrollbar** — scroll indicator at the bottom of the terminal shows when content is wider than the panel
- **Sidebar version** — current version shown next to the title in the sidebar
- **Tap to scroll** — tapping the terminal on mobile scrolls to the cursor position
- **Shift modifier** — Shift button (⇧) on the mobile extra-keys bar enables Shift+Tab, Shift+Arrow, and other modified key sequences (useful for edit mode in Claude/Codex)
- **Extra-keys layout** — added pipe (|) key; Tab and Shift use Unicode symbols (⇥/⇧); ↑ and ↓ arrows are vertically aligned across rows

### Fixes

- `conductor run` now sends the caller's working directory to the server, so sessions start in the correct directory instead of the server's cwd
- Mobile sidebar drawer now closes when creating or resuming a session (previously only closed when opening an existing one)
- Extra-keys drawer toggle now works reliably on mobile after collapsing
- Custom scrollbar drag now works on mobile (was mouse-only; added touch event support)
- Extra-keys drawer no longer overlaps terminal content; terminal resizes to fit above keyboard and drawer
- Vertical touch scroll now works reliably when the virtual keyboard is open
- Horizontal scrollbar now updates immediately after terminal resize instead of waiting up to 500ms
- Terminal now resizes correctly when the mobile keyboard opens — switched to `interactive-widget=resizes-content` so the layout viewport shrinks with the keyboard; title bar stays visible, scrollbars stay within bounds
- Drag-and-drop overlay no longer triggers on internal element drags (only activates for external file drops)
- One-finger touch scroll is now immediate (removed rAF batching that added a frame of input latency); two-finger gestures no longer cause scroll position to jump back on release

## v0.3.2

- **Update notification** — the dashboard checks GitHub for new releases on load and shows a subtle banner at the bottom of the sidebar when an update is available; click to open the release page
- **Reconnect spinner** — the "Server disconnected" status bar now shows a spinning indicator instead of static text
- **Codex resume support** — Codex sessions are always resumable; clicking the play button runs `codex resume`. Added `codex --full-auto` variant with `codex resume --last`
- **Copilot resume support** — GitHub Copilot CLI sessions are always resumable via `copilot --resume` (picker) or `copilot --continue` (most recent). Command changed from `gh copilot` to `copilot` (standalone binary). Added `copilot --allow-all-tools` variant
- **Command-based resume** — new `resume_command` field for agents that manage their own session history (no token extraction needed); used by Codex and Copilot
- **Graceful stop improvements** — SIGINT-first kill prevents Node runtime crashes (Codex); reduced stop sequence delay from 2s to 1s; Copilot uses direct SIGINT instead of PTY text commands for instant shutdown
- **Orphan panel cleanup** — terminal panels are automatically closed when their session disappears from the server
- **Settings reset** — "Reset to defaults" button in the Settings dialog restores built-in command list, directories, and all other settings
- **Unified versioning** — version defined in one place (`pyproject.toml`); backend reads via `importlib.metadata`, frontend fetches from `/info`

## v0.3.1

- **Admin settings panel** — localhost-only Settings dialog in the web dashboard for managing allowed commands, default directories, buffer size, upload limits, and stop timeout. Changes persist to `~/.conductor/config.yaml` and propagate to all connected clients automatically
- **Admin API** — `GET /admin/settings` and `PUT /admin/settings` endpoints (localhost-only, returns 403 for remote clients)
- **Config file** — settings now stored in `~/.conductor/config.yaml`, loaded at startup, merged over built-in defaults
- **Live config updates** — config version tracking via `X-Config-Version` header; all dashboard clients auto-refresh when settings change
- **Terminal resize fix** — split-view panels now resize without cursor drift or spurious scrollbars; rows always match the visible area while columns match the PTY for correct line wrapping
- **Cursor position fix** — eliminated resize oscillation by reading cell dimensions directly from the xterm renderer instead of calling `fit()`, so a single resize per layout change keeps the cursor in place
- **Mobile touch scroll** — direction-locked one-finger scroll (vertical or horizontal) with momentum; `touch-action: none` prevents the browser from hijacking diagonal gestures
- **Mobile horizontal scroll** — wide terminal output scrolls horizontally via the same touch handler when content overflows the panel width
- **Extra-keys modifiers** — Ctrl and Alt buttons on the mobile extra-keys bar now work with virtual keyboard input (e.g. Ctrl+O, Ctrl+C, Alt+F); modifiers auto-clear after each keystroke
- **Extra-keys overlay** — collapsed mobile keys handle overlays the terminal at reduced opacity instead of reserving vertical space
- **Extra-keys positioning** — bar now tracks the visual viewport on mobile so it stays above the keyboard in split-view lower panels instead of jumping to the top of the screen
- **UI contrast** — bumped muted text colors across the dashboard for better readability in sunlight
- **Auth token hint** — Settings dialog shows setup instructions when `CONDUCTOR_TOKEN` is not set
- **Stable Tailscale URLs** — all server connections (Tailscale picker, manual input, QR scanner, QR code dialog, CLI `conductor qr`) now use MagicDNS names instead of bare IPs, so saved servers survive IP changes
- **Tailscale peer names** — devices that report "localhost" as hostname (e.g. Android) now show the MagicDNS device name in the picker instead
- **Robust server shutdown** — `conductor shutdown` now finds the server process via `pgrep` when the PID file is missing
- **CLI `--version` flag** — `conductor --version` prints the current version
- **Auto-start docs** — setup guide for systemd (Linux), launchd (macOS), and Task Scheduler (Windows)
- **CHANGELOG.md** — added changelog with history from v0.1.0
- **README** — table of contents, refined intro and cloud-independence positioning, autostart reference
